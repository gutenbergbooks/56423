<p>“A criticism of life,” says
Matthew Arnold.</p>

<p>“The rhythmic creation of
beauty,” says Edgar Allan Poe—defining
the art of lyric poetry.</p>

<p>“The end of art,” says Victor Cousin (combining Plato
and Aristotle), “is the expression of moral beauty by the
assistance of physical beauty.”</p>

<p>But apply these and other bromidic definitions to the art
and literature of to-day—measure them up against the Sunday
newspaper, or “Peter Pan” at the theatre, or picture
exhibitions of the Independent Artists and the followers of
Matisse—and assuredly there is something wrong, either with
the definitions or with the art.</p>

<p>Then turn to Emile Zola, and take from him this following
dictum, which comes very close to being invulnerable:</p>

<p>“<i>A work of art is a bit of nature seen through a temperament.</i>”</p>

<p>This takes in all the schools, as well as the fiery, untamed
spirits who would break away from schools altogether. Art
is always the same; temperaments differ and become
warped. The academician’s temperamental glass is ruled
off into formal geometrical patterns, and he sees nature as
a kind of problem in perspective. The rabid “impressionist”
looks within himself, and away from nature, and “sees
things” which don’t exist for anyone else. The true artist
gazes straight out upon nature, and forgets himself, and art
comes to him “as easily as lying.”</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="spp10">“What the poet writes.</div>
<div class="spp00">He writes: mankind accepts it if it suits,</div>
<div class="spp00">And that’s success. If not, the poem’s passed</div>

<p>“Music is a woman,” said Richard Wagner. We may well go further
and say: Music is a mother. It is by no mere chance that the
Germans speak of <i>Frau</i> Musica. The devotion of Music to humanity,
in its varying, growing and innumerable needs, is the eternal and
utter devotion of a mother to her child. Music is ever present,
ever watchful, ready to sing to man, whatsoever his need, whether
of consolation, of courage, or of love. Nor does she forsake him
in his evil hour, when none but darker passions can touch his
heart. She will go with her children to the deepest depths, and if
thus terrible has become their need, she will yield to them her
heartbroken sympathy even in their hate and their lust.</p>

<p>Music will make all sacrifice for men. At the cost of
fearful pains of growth, she will change her nature with
their growing, or even their perverse needs. Let her living
sons but call upon her to forsake her earlier nature to sympathize
with the broader and deeper consciousness which
they have wrung from life in their battle with circumstance,
and unhesitatingly she responds. She will indulge a prodigal
Strauss or a Debussy, even to his own harm, and she yields
her best only to him whose sympathy has made him one with
the deep and simple heart of humanity.</p>

<p>In America’s present need of songs breathing the freedom
and courage of the New World, Music, the all-mother, is
present and watchful, and will stand by her latest son until
he is full grown and strong.</p>

<div class="dlnheight11"><p>If it were pro­posed to give, in a
brief state­ment on this sub­ject, even a suc­cinct ac­count of the
whole field, or the simp­lest sort of scien­tif­ic re­view, there
would be lit­tle room for anything else to appear in this volume.
In fact, one deservedly famous frankly avowed that he would not
attempt to say anything on the subject unless he had given the
matter at least a month’s careful consideration, and yet it is
much more than likely that the clientele for whom this particular
book is especially designed would not take the trouble to read an
article that had been prepared after such prolonged and ponderous
thought.</p>

<p>The one thing that has characterized all literature, even
before the art of printing was known, no matter what may
be the definition of the word, is this: Whatever has pith,
human interest, originality and action, however slowly it
may have worried its way through the tired or befuddled
brain of those persons whose privilege it is to see the matter
before publication, will be quick to catch the eye of an
ever alert public.</p>

<p>This is as true of science as of fiction: as universal in
poetry as in prose. A single illustration will suffice: Quite
recently a book, in many ways abstruse, appealing, apparently,
to a limited class of readers, had just that touch of
tenderness, that trail of truth, that caused a tremendous sale,
and exhausted the edition in a remarkably short time.</p>

<p>It was once asked what part of a newspaper was most
interesting; the answer from many readers and from many
lands was practically the same: it depends entirely upon
who does the reading. This is quite as true of literature
in general as of one part. When we reflect for an instant
we must acknowledge that in every thinker’s life there are
periods that differ materially in the attitude towards reading;
that some special line is apt to predominate, even in
one who is known to be a general reader: it may vary with
time, place, conditions—in fact, under almost all conceivable
circumstances—but there is never a time when there
are not more readers in any line than there are books worth
while to meet their needs, or to satisfy their demands; in
short, it is just as true to-day as before or since the thought
was expressed in words—Brains are always at a premium.</p>

<div class="dlnheight11">
<p>The profession of the player is one of the oldest recognized and
in its growth and achievement stands foremost of all the arts.</p>

<p>In its crudest form little
is known, but as a profession it may properly date from the
Chinese and Grecian periods, when players were chosen
from among the infant slaves and trained to the art by
masters, not unlike the painter and the bard.</p>

<p>To the immortal genius of Shakespeare does the world
owe its inexpressible appreciation of the artistic development,
realizing to the fullest degree the possibilities, and
subsequently the mastery, of the art, placing it at once on
the highest pinnacle of achievement and according to it the
laurel of universal popularity.</p>

<p>To this genius is added that of others, each attaining a
greater degree of appreciation, until to-day the art of the
player encompasses the highest attributes of the allied arts.</p>

<p>The player is one who loves, and understands, nature.
To do so he must feel, in the highest sense, the emotions of
the artist, the poet and kindred spirits, because from each
he must cull the choicest petals—the inspiration of the poet,
that he may portray the character; the genius of the artist,
that he may imbue it with life, and the passion of the bard,
and to this the sympathy of a Madonna, the tenderness of
an angel, the love of a mother and the strength of a giant.</p>

<p>The development of the art of the player records the
development of civilization itself. The player and his art
obtains wherever there is civilization. In its highest form it
is at once Literature, Art and Music in harmonious arrangement.
In its possibilities it is Religion, teaching the whole
world by its power:</p>

is only paint-deep at times.</p>

<p>Only the brave can handle the fair.</p>

<p>A pretty girl envies but one girl—a
prettier one.</p>

<p>Many a poor husband is created from
a rich man.</p>

<p>While there is an engagement there’s hope—of liberty.</p>

<p>Men can persuade a woman to do anything she wants to.</p>

<p>Men can be classified; women cannot even be pacified.</p>

<p>A woman’s idea of happiness is to be ideally miserable.</p>

<p>A woman will break a heart as readily as she will crack
a smile.</p>

<p>No married man ever was a fool without being told of
the fact.</p>

<p>The grass widow is not alone in making hay while the
sun shines.</p>

<p>A bachelor is a man who has given serious thought to
matrimony.</p>

<p>Bachelors form their opinion of marriage by experience—of
others.</p>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun except hat styles
for women.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/ia027.jpg" width="600" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><p>“<i>A woman imagines she can cover up her imperfections
by pointing out those of other women.</i>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Every girl would love to be a thing of beauty and a
boy forever.</p>

<p>When a woman proves equal to all a man expects she
is a sur-prize.</p>

<p>It isn’t nearly so hard to be a fool over a widow as
not to be one.</p>

<p>Every woman secretly admires the wisdom of the man
who flatters her.</p>

<p>A woman may conceal her faults, but a decollete gown
is less deceptive.</p>

<p>The blush of a bashful girl is a flush that takes any
hand—and heart.</p>

<p>“The cup of happiness” with men of experience has a
siphon on the side.</p>

<p>Every woman has a horror of old age, but not so much
as of young death.</p>

<p>Women are never satisfied. First they want a voter and
then they want a vote.</p>

<p>Some men are born to trouble, while others merely
achieve it by marriage.</p>

<p>There is but one kind of love, yet every woman has a
different idea about it.</p>

<p>Men, manners and morals change, but woman, never—from
the changeable.</p>

<div class="dctr04">
<img src="images/ia029.jpg" width="747" height="1280" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><p><i>A man may be “out front” at the opera and yet be able
only to “see back”—if he is with her.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Every woman expects a man to think for her, and then
she reverses his opinion.</p>

<p>When it comes to singing the praises of another, most
women have a sore throat.</p>

<p>Man’s principal safeguard against matrimony is that
widows are made, not born.</p>

<p>Many a promising housekeeping career has been ruined
in an unpromising stage career.</p>

<p>Men have found many antidotes for a woman, but the
surest of all is another woman.</p>

<p>A woman spends one-half of her time telling lies for
men and the other half to them.</p>

<p>Women often know a man is in love with them when
the man never discovers the fact.</p>

<p>Men often find it necessary to choose between the inconstant
and the unattractive woman.</p>

<p>A woman keeps a man running all the time—first it is
after her and then it is from her.</p>

<p>If women did not know that men could overcome their
resistance they would seldom resist.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which a woman may win a man:
Her own brilliancy and his inanity.</p>

<p>When a man is at the feet of woman it is pretty sure
that another woman threw him there.</p>

<p>Every woman wants a man to be real devilish before
marriage and real angelic afterwards.</p>

<p>Anyhow, there was one woman who was never jealous.
Adam didn’t have troubles about that.</p>

<p>A woman imagines she can cover up her imperfections
by pointing out those of other women.</p>

<p>Some men are born wise, some achieve wisdom by
experience, and some just don’t marry.</p>

<p>Two kinds of women make trouble in the world—those
that are married and those that are not.</p>

<p>There is but one class of women who are not interested
in the fashions and they are the dead ones.</p>

<p>The philosopher said a woman could not argue—he
was too wise to say that she could not talk.</p>

<p>The reason so many men find marriage unattractive is
because life was so attractive before marriage.</p>

<p>It isn’t a hard matter for a woman to make a man love
her. The difficulty is in making him keep it up.</p>

<p>A woman can make up two things at the same time—her
face and her mind; but her face lasts longer.</p>

<p>The world has no sympathy to waste on those reckless
enough to wed when both have been married before.</p>

<p>If a man does not tell a woman he loves her she thinks
him impossible; if he does, he knows himself foolish.</p>

<p>When a woman says that all she wants is what she
deserves she really means she deserves all she wants.</p>

<p>When a girl reaches that uncertain age and is yet
unmarried, she is often worse than she paints herself.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is more truth than sentiment when a man
tells a woman a thing is as plain as the nose on her face.</p>

<p>No one has ever yet discovered why a woman is afraid
of a mouse and tackles a six-foot man with confidence.</p>

<p>A woman will start a flirtation in fun and then wonder
why a man won’t follow her when she gets serious.</p>

<p>If a man wants to make a fool of himself he can find
many opportunities, but the surest way is over a woman.</p>

<p>Men and women both agree that it is inadvisable to live
without each other and impossible to live with each other.</p>

<p>Whether a married man pities or envies his bachelor
friends depends entirely upon how long he has been married.</p>

<p>If a man really wants to start something with himself,
let him try to love a woman just as a woman wants to be
loved.</p>

<p>The best way to find out what a girl who is in love with
a man thinks of woman suffrage is to find out what he
thinks.</p>

<p>A man may escape the measles, or automobiles, or even
being indicted, but no man has ever been known to escape
a widow.</p>

<p>No woman ever told a man she hated him without
meaning it; some women have told men they loved them
and meant it.</p>

<p>Rather than a man should be right and belong to
another woman, a woman would have him wrong and
belong to her.</p>

<p>The reason widows are so attractive to men is because
they will allow themselves to be taught things they already
know too well.</p>

<p>A girl will gaze for three hours and a half at the moon
and then wonder why she hasn’t time to sew a button on
her brother’s vest.</p>

<p>The happiest man is he who will take a woman’s protestations
like he does a dose of medicine—with celestial
faith in the giver.</p>

<p>When a woman fails to see an opportunity to be generous
to another woman it is not necessarily a sign of
defective eye-sight.</p>

<p>Don’t misunderstand a man when he tells a woman she
is sweet enough to eat—maybe he is thinking of the forthcoming
restaurant-check.</p>

<p>Between the ages of sixteen and thirty a woman is a
general practitioner in the field of love; after that she is
satisfied to become a specialist.</p>

<p>A man is willing to worship at the shrine of a woman
with whom he is in love until he meets another woman—then
he changes his religion.</p>

<p>The question will never be settled between women as to
which will win a man quicker, a pair of silk stockings or
an ability to bake a good cake.</p>

<p>If ever the fact that there are no marriages in Heaven
is generally believed by women, half of the preachers will
be obliged to seek other employment.</p>

<p>If a woman were obliged to express a preference, she
would choose the man who pleases but does not love, to
the man who loves but does not please, her.</p>

<p>Women are said to be more “clean-minded” than men.
Men might meet feminine competition if they resorted to
the stratagem of changing their minds as often.</p>

<p>The greatest disappointment after marriage comes to a
man when he realizes that his wife does not look like the
models in the shop windows during a white-goods sale.</p>

<p>A man can protect himself from the things said about
him by the women who don’t love him. It’s the things
said about him by the woman who does love him that
keep him worried.</p>

<p>Women, says a sage, are like books: No man can judge
the inside by what is displayed on the outside. It is a
poor rule that won’t work both ways. Women are unlike
books: When one has finished with a book it can be
closed up.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.
<span class="hsmall">
MUSIC AND MYSTERY.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">

can stand no more! How, then, can I break this to him?” The
speaker, a radiantly beautiful young girl, stood sobbing in the
great musical emporium of Harry M. Daly &amp; Co.</p>

<p>“Consider me a policeman and not a
piano-mover.” As he said these words, Paul Postelwaite
came forward with his hat in his hand. For all he knew
the damsel in distress might be a carriage customer, and,
besides, he was afraid if he left his hat in the shipping
department a member of the firm might steal it.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” replied the beautiful young girl, “I saw a
pianola advertisement some time ago which said: ‘<i>With
this instrument anyone can play the piano.</i>’ And I, taking
all my little savings, bought one for papa!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“It arrived to-day. Too late, I perceive that a pianola
is an instrument from which music can only be extorted
by the feet, and poor papa was run over by an electric car
and lost both legs.</p>

<div class="dctr02 padtopc">
<img src="images/ia047.jpg" width="800" height="1012" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">“<i>As he said these words,
 Paul Postelwaite came forward.</i>”</div></div>

<p>“It was all my little savings, as I have said. The firm
will not take the pianola back, and my poor papa has no
visible means of support.”</p>

<p>“But you can sue the street railway company for damages,”
said Paul, soothingly.</p>

<p>“We threatened to do that, but the railroad company
only said papa should consider he was sufficiently damaged
and they did not see why he should sue for any more.
However, they said we might bring the matter into court
and they would see what they could do to his character.”</p>

<p>“Go home, little one,” said Paul Postelwaite, kindly,
“and I will come around this evening and play the
pianola for your papa myself.”</p>

<p>The foregoing will show that although Paul moved in
musical circles he was neither a sharp nor a flat. His
worst predilection was that he continually talked shop, for
his last words to his distressed young confidant were,
“Compose yourself!”</p>

<p>Paul Postelwaite had long resolved upon a musical
career. He knew the pitfalls of the profession. On every
side of him he saw and heard the unfortunates who played
the piano to excess. A hater of discord, he resolved to
save the victims of piano-playing from themselves. To
this end he studied piano-moving.</p>

<p>Most pianos are bought on the instalment plan. Most
payers for pianos bought on this plan fall behind in their
instalments. It was Paul’s duty to call and take away
the pianos of those who had been remiss.</p>

<p>He bore abuse and vituperation, not with stolid indifference
but with the conscientious feeling that he was a
public benefactor.</p>

<p>He had the reward of public appreciation. People
afflicted by proximity to those who played the piano to
excess no longer complained to the Board of Health. They
ascertained if any payments were overdue on the instrument
of torture, and then they sent for Paul.</p>

<p>Paul’s father had been a piano-maker. But he had
been overtaken by misfortune. He made pianos for the
big department stores.</p>

<p>But while he only made one grade of piano, he was
compelled by the exigencies of his trade to stencil them
with so many different names that he forgot his own. And
one day, while suffering from loss of memory in this
regard, he signed a name not his own to a check and was
compelled to retire from business to Ossining-on-Hudson.</p>

<p>His father’s parting advice had been, “Never forget
who you are, my boy!”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth padtopa">
<hr class="hr20" />

<h3>CHAPTER II.
<span class="hsmall">
HARMONY IN A FLAT.</span></h3>

<p>That evening, carrying with him a pair of wooden legs,
as a pleasant surprise for the abbreviated parent, Paul
called at the cosy Harlem apartment where dwelt the
young girl who had so attracted his attention that morning.</p></div>

<p>As the young girl opened the door for him with a glad
cry, Paul proffered the wooden legs. “These are for your
father,” he said; “he has a heart of oak, I know, and now
he will have legs to match.”</p>

<p>“Bless you, young sir,” cried the father of the girl.
“This will place me on a better footing with the world!
And should I die they will be a legacy for both of you.
And now, thank gracious! I can play the pianola!”</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/ia050.jpg" width="600" height="510" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><p class="pcontinue">“<i>The
grateful father adjusted the artificial limbs and was
soon playing Handel with his feet.</i>”</p></div></div>

<p>So saying the grateful father adjusted the artificial limbs
and was soon playing Handel with his feet, extracting from
the music chords of wood, as it were, of a timbre most
surprising.</p>

<div class="dctr01 padtopc">
<img src="images/ia051-asterisks.png"
 width="800" height="27" alt="" /></div>

<p class="padtopc">This was not all. Paul secured the old man a political
position as a stump speaker, at which he was doubly successful,
and how he stood on public questions is well known;
his physical disability, of course, stood in the way of his
ever running for office.</p>

<p>As for the daughter, Paul married her. There is no
need to tell you her name. She is Mrs. Postelwaite now
and that is enough.</p>

<p>They are still a musical family, and the pride of their
home is a Baby Grand.</p>

was once a Sagacious Youth, with a High Brow, who Opined that the
World owed him a Living.</p>

<p>“It is all very well,” he reflected, “for
Ordinary Dubs who have not been blessed
with a Superabundance of Gray Matter as I have, to
Strain on the Collar in the Tread Mill of Business, but
the very thought of Work makes me Tired, and I apprehend
that there are Easier ways of getting the Pelf than
by Earning it.</p>

<p>“It is, of course, a Good Thing that not every one is
as Brilliant as I am, for if they were the world would
blow up with Spontaneous Combustion. It really pains
me to see others toiling along day after day for Measly
Salaries, when they might have money coming to them
on Wings if they only used their Wits instead of their
Paws.”</p>

<p>With that the Sagacious Youth worked out a system
that was a Sure Thing on paper for Divorcing the Public
from its Long Green.</p>

<div class="dctr05">
<img src="images/ia061.png" width="457" height="918" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">“<i>There was once a Sagacious
 Youth with a High Brow.</i>”</div></div>

<p>“I learned from the Census Report,” he said to himself,
“that every Minute a Sucker is Born, and I apprehend
that they are Providentially provided to furnish Automobiles
and Wealth Water for Wise Guys like Me,
and that all that I shall have to do is to take advantage
of their Gullibility in order to Hook Them and have a
Fish Chowder that will be a Perpetual Picnic.</p>

<p>“I have perceived that most of my Fellow Creatures
are so Greedy that they will swallow any sort of Bait if
it looks Fat, and that if you only Promise them enough,
it Razzle-dazzles them so they do not investigate your
means of Making Good.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the Youth began burning the midnight Carbon
concocting a Prospectus of Speculation made Easy,
by which Widows and Orphans and Clergymen could be
separated from their Pile and enjoy all the Excitement and
Losses of Wall Street at Home.</p>

<p>As an idea it was a Jim Dandy that commanded the
respect of the Financial World, but before the Youth could
realize it the Post-Office Department got Wise, and he
felt it best to Travel in Europe for his Health.</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried the Youth, “I fear that the Confidence
Game is getting Over-Crowded, and it is evidently up to
me to either Marry and give some Female the Pleasure of
Supporting me, or else go to Work.</p>

<p>“Personally, my tastes are not Domestic, and I prefer
Single Blessedness to Double Wretchedness, but it is clear
that it will be less Fatiguing to hold a Lady’s Hand than
to call Stations in the Subway; it’s me for the Altar.
Besides, as soon as I have annexed little Tootsey-Wootsey
for my own, I will take possession of her Bank Account
and then all will be well.”</p>

<p>So the Youth espoused an Elderly Widow whose No. 1
husband had left her a Large and Juicy slice of Insurance,
but contrary to his expectations she was a Foxy Lady with
a Time Lock on her Pocketbook, and he could not work
the Combination that opened it.</p>

<p>At this the Youth shed bitter Tears, but when he began
knocking Fate his Friend called him down.</p>

<p>“It may be True,” said the Friend, “that the World
owes you a living, but there are many Small Debts that
we have to Personally Collect.</p>

<p>“If you had displayed as much Imagination in writing
Fiction as you have in Telling Lies that deceive no one,
you would have received an Honorary Degree from Yale
instead of the Double Cross from your Fellow Creatures,
and if you had worked as hard at some Honest Calling
as you have in trying to Rob Others you would be a
Millionaire instead of a Tramp. It is my observation that
the Beater always gets Beaten in the end. Farewell!”</p>

<hr class="hr20" />

<p>Moral: This Fable teaches that Most of the Short Cuts
to Success end on the Dump.</p>

will come over Wednesday evening?”
She asked it hesitatingly, timidly
almost.</p>

<p class="pfirst">“I’m afraid I can’t Wednesday,” as
he picked up his hat and cane.</p>

<p>“Then Thursday—have you an engagement for Thursday?”</p>

<p>“Thursday is the dinner of the Civic Club.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; of course you must go to that.” There
was a slight quiver in her voice now. “Could—could you
come—Friday?”</p>

<p>“That’s so far ahead. I don’t like to make an engagement
so far in advance. But I’ll phone you some time
during the week.”</p>

<p>She smiled a wan little assent. With a brief good-by
he was gone. His step down the hall—the click of the
elevator—then she ran to the window and followed him
with strained eyes as he swung down the street.</p>

<p>If only he would look up and wave her a good-by as
he used to—but he did not.</p>

<p>She threw herself on the couch, her face in the pillows—the
ache in her heart keener than any physical pain.
Was it hopeless—the fight she was making? Could she
never win back the love she had lost?</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/ia085.jpg" width="800" height="828" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><p>“<i>There she sat, with
 her head bend­ing low, think­ing, think­ing,
 think­ing.</i>”</p></div></div>

<p>And she had never known how she had lost it—unless
it was because she had grown to care too much and to
show it too plainly. Could it be that? Had he cared
only for the uncertainty—the love of pursuit? And without
that—being sure of his conquest—his interest had died?</p>

<p>Ah, no—no! passionately she denied that. The man
she loved was bigger, finer than that! He could not have
stooped to a merely cheap desire for conquest. If he had
ceased to love her, it was some fault of hers, some failing,
some lack within herself of which she was unconscious.</p>

<p>She had spent long hours of torturing self-analysis trying
to find where she had failed—what it was that in the
beginning he might have thought she possessed—and then
found she did not. So great was her love for him that
she felt she could almost make of herself what he wanted—just
by the sheer strength of <i>willing</i> it!</p>

<p>If only she could be with him enough! If she could
but have the <i>chance</i> to make him care for her again! He
used to come almost every day—and now—now, sometimes
many days would pass.</p>

<p>She knew it was a mistake to ask him when he was
coming—to try to name any particular time. He seemed
to resent that now. If only she could let him go without
a word! But the thought of the long, silent absence that
might follow always terrified her. Once, for two weeks,
she had not heard from him; and the memory of those two
weeks’ suffering always weakened her to the point of trying
to make some definite engagement to escape the sickening
uncertainty of the days to come.</p>

<p>Oh, she was so helpless—so pitiably helpless! Wholly
dependent on him for her happiness, yet powerless to break
down this wall he was placing between them!</p>

<p>She slowly arose and threw herself into a chair. There
she sat, with her head bending low, thinking, thinking, thinking.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/ia051-asterisks.png"
 width="800" height="27" alt="" /></div>

<p>Then gradually there stole over her a sense of quiet—almost
of peace. It was partly the relaxation that comes
after any emotional strain, and partly because of a faint
hope, a belief that sometimes came to her and that comforted
her above everything else—the thought that because
she gave of her best—because the love she gave was a great
and good love—some time he could come to know, to
understand, and to love her again, if only for her unfaltering
love of him!</p>

<p>If she could but wait long enough—patiently enough—in
the end the love she so wanted might be hers!</p>

   src="images/ia106a.jpg" width="139" height="155"
   alt="A" /></span>&#xa0;VERY long time ago, when the Heavens
were quite new and the Earth was still in
the Golden Age, a strange event occurred—quite
unheard of even in those early
times.</p>

<p>The Sun, vigorous and lusty, had rubbed his blinking
eyes and hurried away to the west. The boy-child, Twilight,
his chubby hands still clutching after the last red
rays left behind by the Sun, winked his sleepy eyes, as,
protestingly, he was pushed along in his crimson cart by
Old Sandman. Close behind came his three sisters, the
Evening Shadows, in their long, trailing, gray robes. A
hush fell upon the Heavens. From far below came the
hum of the Crickets and the low murmur of the Katydids,
having their final good-night gossip, but in the Sky all was
still until the Moonlady came softly creeping along, her
silver mantle enfolding her slight form, her long silken hair
caught by the Evening Breeze, who followed close in her
wake. At her appearance there arose from the Earth
songs of gladness and hymns of praise. Lovers looked up
at her enraptured, poets sang of her, and even the brute
creation sent Heavenward their low murmur of joy at her
being. Silently she smiled down upon them all as she
passed on her way.</p>

<div class="dctr03">
<img src="images/ia107.jpg" width="800" height="1232" alt="" />
<p class="fsz7">“<i>The Moonlady stole softly
across the sky.</i>”</p></div><!--dctr03-->

<p>Then a strange thing happened. Black clouds skurried
here and there across the Heavens, and low mutterings
were heard. The Stars had revolted!</p>

<p>Venus, her cold beauty marred by a frown of discontent,
was the center of a murmuring group, to whom she
spoke in words of passion:</p>

<p>“Let us take a firm stand. Why should we go on shining,
shining through countless ages? We are not appreciated.
We never receive any praise. There are so many
of us and our light is so feeble, who cares whether we
shine or not? The Moon comes along and takes away
our glory; let her do all the work then. Why should
we waste our light trying to outshine the Moon and the
Sun? Unless we can be as brilliant as they and receive
as much praise, let us not shine at all.”</p>

<p>Each Star blinked a sullen assent, and gradually each
little light flickered and went out. The Dog Star barked
and the Great Bears growled—the low mutterings became
a loud rumble, and the Heavens for once were dark, save
for a faint light that still gleamed away off in the north.
Seeing the feeble light still shining, all the Stars rushed to
it, surrounding the feeble Star that persisted in shining, and
jeered at her folly.</p>

<p>“Put out your light, you foolish one. Do you hope to
vie with the Sun or the Moon with that feeble flame of
yours? What use can you be in this great space of darkness?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied the Star, faintly, “but I can
go on shining and do my best, though my light is small
and goes but a little way. I do not envy the Moonlady
her glory. Is it not a great thing that she can shine so
radiantly upon the Earth and make so many happy? And
if there were no Sun, what would the poor little Flowers
do, and the Birds and the Beasts? My little light cannot
do much good, but I can do my best to keep it bright, and
if it reaches to Earth but faintly I shall be grateful. I
had rather light one soul onward and upward than to have
a choir of Angels sing my praises; I had rather one
person should be glad he had seen my rays, than to be
crowned with a crown of brilliant jewels and never have
made anyone glad; I had rather one tearful soul should
look to me and find comfort in my steady light than to
have a million people bow down to me in worship of my
beauty; I had rather one soul should be truly sorry when
my light goes out than that a thousand should praise me for
my brilliancy and not know when I ceased to shine; I
had rather a baby’s face looked up at me and smiled and
called my name than to be praised in a poet’s song and
know he was paid so much a line for it; I had rather
send one faint ray of hope into some troubled heart than
to light the World’s Great White Way; I had rather
shine on for ages unnoticed than to shine with borrowed
light and be afraid of being blown out; I had
rather<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2015twice.png" width="133" height="60" alt="――" />”
But the little Star found herself all alone, and as she looked
about her she saw that each Star was in its accustomed
place, and that each light was more brilliant than it had
ever been before. Even the dark clouds had vanished, and
a little child looked up at the Sky from her bedroom window
and said, “O, mother dear, see how beautiful are the
stars to-night! They are God’s jewels, set in His Crown
of Glory, aren’t they? If we are very good shall we be
beautiful stars some day and shine for Him?”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>And the Stars looked down and smiled Good-night.
And the brightest of all the Stars were the Pleiades.</p>

on the north by top-floor bedrooms, lying
above the frost-line, because the steam register
always gets discouraged and quits one
story below. It is bounded on the south
by basement dining-rooms, where it is night
six months a year and just before daylight the rest of the
time; on the east by an entrance hall agreeably perfumed
with the combined aroma of kerosene, mother-of-onion,
veteran linoleum and the stuffing in the red-plush sofa, and
on the west by a parlor nine feet wide and thirty-two feet
long, with one window in it and a doctor’s sign in the window.
The doctor’s private office lies just back of the parlor,
so the parlor smells mildewed when the connecting door is
closed and iodoformed when it’s open.</p>

<p>Boarders, as the natives of this land are commonly called,
are never allowed in the parlor except once, that occasion
being when they first apply for board. Thereafter they
entertain their company on the front stoop in the summer and
on the telephone in the winter. Winter company is the
more expensive.</p>

<p>The ruling classes of Hallroumania are known as Landladies
and may be classed generally into the following subdivisions:
Landladies who belong to Old Southern Families
and formerly rode in Their Own Carriages, but suffered
Heavy Financial Reverses through the Cruel War brought
on By Your Mister Lincoln; Landladies who never married
and don’t regret it; Landladies who did marry and frequently
regret it; Landladies who have no use for husbands, and
Landladies who have husbands and use them to take the dog
out.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are indeed a weird race, including unrecognized
geniuses, earnest hopers, chronic grouches, back files
and innocent bystanders; also single gentlemen who are believed
to have had what is known as A PAST, and who are
suspected of leading the dissipated life because they come in
of an evening with the odor of rum and Business Men’s
Lunch on their breath; also young women of undoubted
dramatic power, who won the first prize for elocution at the
Rome Centre School of Expression and came on two winters
ago to put Julia Marlowe out of the business, but are being
kept back temporarily owing to a jealous compact on the
part of the theatrical syndicate; also other young women
who think they are entitled to bird-like notes because they
had the thrush once, and were sent here at heavy expense by
fond parents who imagine New York as a place full of
talented voice-plumbers who know how to weld Nellie Melba
pipes on a Ruth Ann larynx; also single ladies who spend
part of the time drying handkerchiefs on the window-panes
and doing light laundry work in a toothbrush-mug, and the
rest of the time making life brighter and sweeter for a pug
dog with the asthma.</p>

<p>Also dashing gents connected with leading brokerage
offices downtown, who wear priceless marquise rings on the
little finger of the right hand, and go secretly away at night
owing for two weeks; also persons of both sexes who have
been misunderstood by the world and crave A Little Sympathy—that
is all; also ladies who are constantly on the
verge of moving to a perfectly delightful place up in Ninety-third
Street because a fur-bearing foreigner has opened a
Pants-Pressery next door and the neighborhood is rapidly
losing its tone; also, just plain boarders.</p>

<p>A boarder is often likened to a worm. And this is a
proper comparison if it is a tapeworm that is meant, because
a tapeworm always knows in advance what it is going to
have for dinner, and so does a boarder. For instance, he
knows that on Monday night he will have a New England
boiled dinner that tastes like the family wash on Friday
night, one gill and part of the dorsal fin of a boiled fish, and
on Sunday evening that nourishing repast known as cold
Sunday-night tea.</p>

<p>This cold tea is probably the most noted of the established
institutions of Hallroumania, being constituted as follows:
A dank cold platter, veneered at rare intervals with specimens
of the Old Red Corned-Beef Period of Geology, cut to the
generous thickness of gold leaf; a peculiar variety of potato-salad,
in a free state of perspiration and garnished at intervals
with slices of pickled beets, like a few red chips strewn
on the kitty; four small squares of petrified pastry (not suitable
for food, but could be given to hardy children to cut
their teeth on); a prune-floater, bloated up and nine days
drowned in its own juice; a cup of ostensible tea.</p>

<p>The common recreations of The Boarderland are rushing
the washstand-duck in a dress-suit case; wondering how the
other boarders can afford the clothes they wear; progressive
knocking and raising scandals from the slip. The prevalent
disease is Furnished Rheumatism, brought on by living in
a single-breasted apartment, and is marked by a cramped,
choking sensation, the symptoms being almost identical with
those of Harlem Flatulency.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
